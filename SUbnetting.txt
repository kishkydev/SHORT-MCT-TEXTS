1. Divide 195.5.20.0  50 networks .
what is the number of assignable Ips (hosts) in each of the new Subnets?
What is the subnet mask of each of the new subnet ( answer in binary and slash notation)
Can you have more than 50 networks?
If yes, what is the range of the last Subnets?

2. Divide 10.20.0.0   16 networks.
